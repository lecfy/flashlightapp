# flashlightapp

Simple Flashlight App made with Flutter

It uses a library provided by https://pub.dev/packages/flashlight

Tested on Google Pixel 4 XL running Android 11 and 12

You can run it in emulator (though obviously the flash won't work, just the interface and the buttons) or on an actual android device
`flutter run`

to build apk
`flutter build apk`
(it will save it in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk)
